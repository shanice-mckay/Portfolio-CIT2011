        <h2>Reflection on "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</h2>
        <p>In Chapters 4–7, the authors talk about how personal growth, building good relationships, and having balance in life are key to real success. They explain that success isn’t just about money. It’s about being emotionally healthy, having strong connections with others, and staying disciplined. Some of the main ideas they focus on are constantly working on yourself, using your time wisely, and finding mentors to guide you.</p>

        <p>One thing that really stood out to me was how important it is to be intentional with your time. The book explains how time is limited, so prioritizing what matters most can make a huge difference in both your personal and professional life. This hit home for me because I’ve been struggling to juggle my schoolwork and my executive postions. After reading this, I realized I need to set clearer priorities and manage my schedule better so I don’t continue falling behind.</p>

        <p>Another thing I connected with was the idea of nurturing relationships. The book talks about how strong, meaningful connections can bring joy. I’ve experienced this, where collaborating with others has been really rewarding. It’s made me want to put more effort into maintaining those relationships, whether it’s with friends, mentors, or peers, because they’re important.</p>

        <p>The last thing that stuck with me was the importance of discipline and persistence. The book shows how staying focused and consistent can help you achieve long-term goals, which really ties into what I want for my future. I know I need to stay committed to improving my skills and following my passion especially since there are so many things I want to accomplish. Overall, Twelve Pillars reminded me that success isn’t just about reaching your goals—it’s about living a balanced, meaningful life while you’re at it.</p>
