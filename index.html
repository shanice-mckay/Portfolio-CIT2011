        <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. I’m a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Technology, Jamaica, with a passion for blending media and technology.<br><br>

            When I’m not coding you can usually find me with my headphones in, diving into a playlist. Music is my constant companion and fuels my creativity whether I’m vibing to Tyler, the Creator, Hiatus Kaiyote or jamming out to Willow Smith. <br><br>

            Currently, I’m making moves as the Deputy Public Relations Officer on the UTech, Ja. Students' Union Public Relations Committee and I also serve as the Public Relations Officer/Editor for Hall A, Home of the Acropolytes.<br><br>

            I love snickers, having genuine people around me, reading and watching romance movies/series.
            
            Explore my journey.</p>
