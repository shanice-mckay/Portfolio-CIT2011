        <h2>Academic Life and Me</h2>
        <p> I believe that my curiosity drives my interest in self-improvement. It makes me want to explore new experiences.</p>
        <p> Gratitude helps me appreciate the opportunities I have, even when the workload feels overwhelming.</p>
        <p> Public relations takes up a lot of my time, but this has occasionally impacted my academic life negatively. Balancing the demands of it with my schoolwork has been challenging especially this semester. However, I want to better understand my tendencies so I can know how to manage both responsibilities without sacrificing my progress in either of them.</p>

        <h2>My Hero: Tyler, the Creator</h2>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “Bro, just be proud of whatever you're making.” — Tyler, the Creator</p>
        <p> Tyler, the Creator is my hero because of his unapologetic individuality and creative genius. He openly explores different forms of art, from music to fashion to filmmaking, which inspires me as a multipotentialite. His journey from being an unconventional rapper all those years ago to a Grammy-winning artist now shows that staying authentic can lead to success. His has this insane ability of creating worlds through his work which encourages me. One thing about him is that he always believed in himself even when the people around him didn't understand the vision.</p>

        <h2>Personality Test Results</h2>

        <p> Based on the test, I'm an Idealist. I think it's quite accurate. I am obsessed with personlity tests so the results match up with other tests. The idea of imagining possibilities and striving for harmony also reflects how I approach both my academic and personal life. Overall, I think the test has some validity, especially in providing insight into tendencies I might not have fully articulated before.</p>
